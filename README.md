This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases an Express app that uses a promise-based asynchronous function (`someAsyncOperation`) without proper error handling. If `someAsyncOperation` throws an error, the application fails silently and the error isn't properly caught by Express.js's middleware. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to correct this issue by using appropriate error handling with a `try...catch` block or using `.catch()` appropriately within asynchronous operations.
